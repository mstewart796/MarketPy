# MarketPy
A  project that emulates buying from a shop. Includes adding items to the catalogue, adding to the shopping 
basket, checkout and more.

Through mercado.py, the user sees options 1 to 7 (register product, list products available, buy product, view
basket, finalize purchase and exit). This simulates online retail with individual codes for products and values
of the products automatically summed.

This project was created as part of my Python course with Geek University.
